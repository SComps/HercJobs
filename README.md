# HercJobs

A windows GUI application to submit jobs to a Hercules guest via TCP/IP to a hercules
3505 card reader set up as sockdev.

This is a work in progress.  Future additions will hopefully be to intercept the printer
output, not only for this job, but all jobs such as Virtual1403 does.  Note, Virtual1403 
is definitely the best printer application for Hercules (and I personally use it).  This
application will pale in comparison for that job.  I'm intending to include this functionality
as a personal challenge.
